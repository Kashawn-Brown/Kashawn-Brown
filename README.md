### 🏆 Featured Projects

**MicroFlix (Java 21 · Spring Boot · PostgreSQL · Next.js)**  
Production-minded movie platform showcasing Java/Spring microservices, a Next.js frontend, and realistic deployment practices. Backend services expose JWT-secured APIs over Spring Cloud Gateway, backed by per-service PostgreSQL databases, Flyway migrations, and TMDb-powered catalog seeding. The system adds aggregation endpoints for combined movie/rating/watchlist views, targeted DB indexing, and Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus/Grafana for health and metrics. A GitHub Actions CI pipeline builds/tests all services and images, and the stack is deployable to AWS/GCP via Docker, making MicroFlix a complete example of full-stack microservices from local dev to cloud.

**Career-Tracker (Fastify · PostgreSQL · Auth)**  
Job Application Manager: An application to replace spreadsheets like Excel and Notion to go beyond basic fields. In addition to company, role, stage, dates, and compensation, each application can link people who helped (connections/outreach), attach a tailored resume and cover letter for that role and more. An activity log keeps changes honest, with CSV import, stage filters for quick follow-ups, etc. Deployed via Railway (API) and Vercel (UI).

**MovieVault (React · Express · Node · MongoDB · TMDb API)**  
Movie Discovery & Reviews: My first solo build after school. A full-stack app for exploring and reviewing movies with live TMDb integration. I used it to practice REST API design and a responsive, polished React UI—versioned endpoints, typed/request-response shapes, pagination/filtering, and explicit error contracts, with optimistic updates on the front end. Unlike MicroFlix (which centers your own lists/history), MovieVault is about open discovery in a clean, cohesive app.

**DataQuest Hackathon - Brescia Norton Classifier**  
We built Booking-cancellation classifier that hit 89% accuracy on held-out data (~10% over baseline). Compared SVC/KNN/MLP→XGBoost and chose XGBoost; Mutual Information feature ranking reduced selection time by ~20%. 3rd place at a hackathon for model design + presentation.
